Here you'll find my independent projects in:

Machine Learning (ML) & AI – Model development, predictive analytics, and AI-driven simulations.
Data Science & Analytics – Statistical modeling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization.
SQL & Big Data – Query optimization, database management, and scalable data solutions.
I hold a B.S. in Applied Mathematics, and I’m continuously expanding my expertise in ML, AI, and data-driven decision-making. My recent work involves F1 telemetry analysis, strategy simulations, and AI-enhanced analytics.

🔍 What I’m working on now:

Currently I am entered in the 2025 March Madness Machine Learning Mania sponsored by Google. I am competing with Data Scientists around the world to build the most accurate March Madness predictive model! The final deadline is March 20th. When submitted I will upload my work on here to share.
