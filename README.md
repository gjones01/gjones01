Machine Learning (ML) & AI ‚Äì Model development, predictive analytics, and AI-driven simulations.
Data Science & Analytics ‚Äì Statistical modeling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization.
SQL & Big Data ‚Äì Query optimization, database management, and scalable data solutions.
I hold a B.S. in Applied Mathematics.

üîç What I‚Äôm working on now:

Currently I am engineering a bot detection algorithm for X.com (formerly Twitter.) In conjunction with this algorithm I am utilizing their "X API" to live stream
X feeds to determine the legitimacy of accounts. In other words, be able to flag an account as most likely human or most likely a bot! This also has given me the chance to play with
Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) to turn complex textual data into binary vectors to feed into a machine learning model. This classification task is common in many modern infastructures and
can be deployed for all sorts of roles (fraudulent transaction detection, anti-cheat softwares for competitive video games, or
determining whether a person utilized an LLM to produce written work).
