Here you'll find my independent projects in:

Machine Learning – Predictive modeling, classification systems and neural networks

Data Science & Analytics – EDA, statistical modeling, and data visualization

SQL & Big Data – Query optimization, relational databases, and scalable data pipelines

- B.S. in Applied Mathematics

- What I’m working on now:

For the past 7 months I have been developing a computer vision model that analyzes short Counter-Strike footage to identify cheating behavior. At the moment, data collection is the current state of the project, with the model pipeline itself already being prototyped. Concurrently, I am creating a statistical tool, using the Leetify API, that pulls relevant Counter-Strike stats for a player and then further derives granular metrics that would highlight unusual gameplay. Currently, I am building a website to make the tool public. If this interests you at all, please check out the ClarityCS repository.
