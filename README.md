🔍 What I’m working on now:

Currently I am developing a Deep Learning Neural Network cheat detection algorithm for the popular first person shooter, Counter Strike 2. This is utilizing computer vision to watch sample demo clips from players and identify whether they are cheating or legitimate.
It is in the first phase so far with a rough prototype working and a crowdsource of gameplay from the Counter Strike community. With their help they are making this possible. This isn't meant to be a ban system but rather an analysis tool in an attempt to solve a current problem in competitive gaming.
