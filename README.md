- My name is Gerry Jones and here you will find my independent projects where I am currently learning:
- Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) and Machine Learning (ML).
- I currently have my B.S. in Applied Mathematics and am expanding my skillsets
- and competency with larger data structures and eventually predictive models. When I am not working, I love to play golf, chess and workout.
- Reach me at: gerryjonesjr@gmail.com if you are interested in collaborating or would like to know more about what I do.
