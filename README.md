🔍 What I’m working on now:

Currently I am engineering a bot detection algorithm for X.com (formerly Twitter), using the X API to stream live feeds and classify accounts as likely human or likely bot.

This project uses TF-IDF for uniquely quantify textual data to the nfeed into a machine learning classifier. It’s a practical application of binary classification, with broader use cases in fraud detection and anti-cheat algorithms for video games.
